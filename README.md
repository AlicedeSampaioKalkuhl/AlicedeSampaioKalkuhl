### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a Genetics student working on gene duplications with a focus on Cnidarians. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to get better at using Bioconductor packages.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on epidemiological models (I did my master thesis on an SEIR model)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with tidying code.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: mathematical modelling and tidyverse plots
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: alice@quantumlandbooks.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I write fiction for fun. My books are [here](https://quantumlandbooks.com/books)

### other research I'm involved in
- anaylsis and modelling of phenotypic plasticity and behaviour in Daphnia magna in response to toxins (started during my undegrad) 
- mathematical modelling of haemorrhagic fever transmission (started during my masters) 
- evolution of filovirus endogenous elements (colaboration)
- palaeontology side projects (started during my undergrad)
- quantum biology modelling (started during my undergrad)
- gene duplications in *Hexacorallia* (MSc in Genetics)
- bat parasitology (data collection for [https://batbase.org](https://batbase.org))

- evolution of collagen (literature review and independent research project, BSc. in Genetics)
- bat ecology and preservation in NRW, Germany (as part of "Arbeitskreis fÃ¼r Artenvielfalt)
- colour changes in butterfly wings (published [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315495377_Colour_changes_due_to_interference_at_the_wings_of_blue_Rhopalocera))
