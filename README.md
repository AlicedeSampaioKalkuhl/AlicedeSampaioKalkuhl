### Hi there 👋


- 🔭 I'm an author and epidemiologist with an interest in how disease tranmission and population dynamics interact over long time periods
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to get better at using Bioconductor packages.
- 👯 I’m looking for funding for palaeoepidemiology research.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with tidying code.
- 💬 Ask me about: mathematical modelling and tidyverse plots
- 📫 How to reach me: alice@quantumlandbooks.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I play rugby and am mostly a scrum-half

### other research I'm involved in
- anaylsis and modelling of phenotypic plasticity and behaviour in Daphnia magna in response to toxins (started during my undegrad) 
- mathematical modelling of haemorrhagic fever transmission (started during my masters) 
- evolution of filovirus endogenous elements (colaboration)
- palaeontology side projects (started during my undergrad)
- quantum biology modelling (started during my undergrad)
- gene duplications in *Hexacorallia* (MSc in Genetics)
- bat parasitology (data collection for [https://batbase.org](https://batbase.org))
